        <a id="quo"><h1>Favorite Quote</h1></a>
        <p>My Favorite Quote is :“Can't never did anything, until he tried.” ― F. Lee Hayslip 
          <br>
           the reason that i like this quote is because it is true everything will be impossible and you can't do it unless you actually try</p>
